### Who *are* you?
[I'm a](https://slightknack.dev/about) [Software Architect](https://apenwarr.ca/log/20201227) [interested in](https://slightknack.dev) [Reinforcement Learning,](https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/Rm6oQRJJmhGCcLvxh/p/i3BTagvt3HbPMx6PN) [Programming Language Design,](https://github.com/vrtbl/passerine) [and Graphics Programming.](https://github.com/slightknack/keikan)

### What*cha* doin'?
This summer I'm implementing [Wasm](https://webassembly.org/)-based plugins for [Zed](https://zed.dev), a collaborative text editor by the same folks who wrote [Atom](https://atom.io). In my free time I develop [Passerine](https://passerine.io)—a neat little programming language of sorts—which is currently undergoing a ~~big refactor~~ [massive rewrite](https://github.com/vrtbl/passerine/pull/52).
