# Isaac Clayton
I'm a student and  Software Architect currently working on Reinforcement Learning, Programming Language Design, and Graphics Programming—I've also been programming for the better part of a decade. If you appreciate my work, [say hi 👋](mailto:hello@slightknack.dev), or check out [my website ❃](https://www.slightknack.dev/home)

## What have you done?
I've worked on quite a lot. Right now, I'm currently developing [Passerine](https://github.com/vrtbl/passerine) a quick embeddable programming language of sorts. I've only very recently migrated to this account, so the projects here this aren't a full and accurate representation of the full breadth of what I've done.
