# Isaac Clayton
This is a condensed version of the [overview that can be found on my website](https://www.slightknack.dev/home).

## Who am I?
I'm a highschool student who *really* enjoys general programming. If you appreciate my work, [say hi ðŸ‘‹](mailto:hello@slightknack.dev).

## No, but who really are you?
My name's Isaac Clayton, and I'm a Software Architect currently working in the fields of Reinforcement Learning, Programming Language Design, and Graphics Programming. I've been programming for the better part of a decade. Language design has always been a very fascinating for me, and as such, I've become quite the PL polyglot; I've picked up a couple dozen languages in my time and have even hacked on a few of my own. Programmatic expression transcends the medium through which it is expressed; give me any new language and I'll usually pick it up within the hour.

## What are/have you work(ing/ed) on?
I've done quite a lot. Right now, I'm currently working on [Passerine](https://github.com/vrtbl/passerine), a programming language of sorts. In the past, I've also worked on real-time graphics systems, surprisal-based reinforcement learning, real time communication, and so on. I've only very recently migrated to this account, so the projects here this aren't a full and accuracte representation of the full breadth of what I've done.
