Currently in my last year of high school, I'm a Software Architect working on problems in the fields of Reinforcement Learning, Programming Language Design, and Graphics Programming. I have a [website](https://slightknack.dev) where I [write occationally](https://www.slightknack.dev/blog). I'm always open to chat, so why not drop by and [say hello](mailto:hello@slightknack.dev)?

### What are you working on?
In my free time, I develop [Passerine](https://github.com/vrtbl/passerine), a quick embeddable programming language of sorts. I also maintain the toy rendering engine [Keikan](https://github.com/slightknack/keikan), as well as a few other projects. This past summer I interned at [tonari](https://tonari.no), where I tackled computer vision probelms and programmed GPUs.
