# Isaac Clayton
I'm a student and  Software Architect currently working on problems in the domains of Reinforcement Learning, Programming Language Design, and Graphics Programming. If you appreciate my work, [say hi 👋](mailto:hello@slightknack.dev), or check out [my website 🔗](https://www.slightknack.dev).

## What are you working on?
Right now, I'm currently developing [Passerine](https://github.com/vrtbl/passerine), a quick embeddable programming language of sorts. I'm also maintaining [Keikan](https://github.com/slightknack/keikan), as well as a few other projects. I've only very recently migrated to this account, so the projects here aren't a full and accurate representation of the full breadth of what I've done.
